# ECG Record to CSV convert
By using wfdb applications that I some edited code converting ecg record datasets. For pre-processing AI train or test data. 

## Databases descripitions
All database is from <a href="http://physionet.org">physionet</a>. But I don't know reason why aha database is not working well in my case. Maybe that database is just a exculde databases. 

If you want original AHA database then u have to contact to AHA database staff. 

CUDB, ESC DB, NST DB is on here, MIT-BIH is available in phyionet but I didn't added. Simply reason. I wasn't need that db. So if you want to dwonload mit-bih database then searching it on physoinet.
